# risotto
Simple and minimal to-do list for everyday use. You'll need [jackeyfont](http://nonty.net/font/jackey_font/) and [Overpass](http://overpassfont.org/) if you want a qt list.

Check it out [here](https://pprobst.github.io/risotto/todo.html).

This is a WIP, I wrote it to train my JS and DOM a little bit. I'll probably add more features in the future. 

I named this repository "risotto" as a silly pun: Japanese people probably pronounce the english word *list* as *risuto*, which is similar to *risotto*, an Italian food that I unironically dislike.
